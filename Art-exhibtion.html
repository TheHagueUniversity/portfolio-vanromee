                        <h1>Curatorial Rationale</h1>
                        <p>I started my art project with making a mind map. I looked for items to weave and came up with the idea to combine food with normal kitchen utensils <br>and photograph this in a special situation. What remained one of the items throughout my work was the weaving pattern. As in every experimental <br> process accidents happen. During my experimenting with weaving patterns and ink, I had to remove ink spills. The effect of the ink spills on the<br> tissues gave me new inspiration. So I experimented further with tissues and ink. In the last part of my work I was inspired by my visit to the K20 <br>museum in Dusseldorf which showed the works of Andreas Gursky. His works appealed very much to me because of the scale and techniques. Thus, <br> I tried to implement his idea but based on my interpretation. My artworks show a certain size combined with colour and certain dynamics. <br>
                                <br>
                                My selection of works is based on three parts, which reflects the evolution which started with my first idea of using weaving. I started out weaving <br> in combining food and kitchen utensils seen in my work “Gevlochten Kaas”. The following three works was an experiment of weaving patterns using <br> ink and crayon. During the experimenting I was taken by the dynamics of the process which lead to the video art. Then the experimental accident <br>lead to a new inspiration for further artworks. In this second phase of my art project ink water and tissues were the bases of several experiments. <br>In experimenting with the effects of these materials I came up with very colourful and interesting visual results. It resulted in works that are more<br> three dimensional. My last pieces of artworks represent some larger items. In the work of Gursky, size, depth, and replication were a key. I used<br> those with my own twist. Andreas Gursky’s use of large scaled works and Chiharu Shiota’s use of lines played a role in influencing my style of work. <br>My works “Carla” and “Eerste” clearly show these influences and techniques. <br>
                                <br>
                                I set up my exhibition in such a way that the viewer has to use more dimensions. Not only the straight view on the walls, but also up and down. I want <br>my viewers to really be inside the exhibition, and the exhibition goes around them. The second important aspect that I would like to transfer to the <br>visitor of the exhibition is the expression of colours. In my art project I used a lot of colourful materials, which are reflected in my artworks. <br>A further impression I would like to transfer to my audience is the dynamics I saw from the process of making my artwork. For this I used new digital <br>techniques like video and animated GIF. By making this repetitive it became art in itself. After being through this complete creative process of my art<br> exhibition, afterwards I can conclude that one of the main themes has been repetition. And I am very curious if my visitors to my exhibition come to<br> the same conclusions.
